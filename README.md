It is used by artisans to advertise their services. A client can use it to hire the service of an artisan.

When a client gets to the home page, he/she can instantly browse through the posted services and select the needed service. A new client is required to
register as hirer to be allowed to engage the service. This action allows the app to obtain the details of the client to be used to process the contract.
An email message is instantly sent to the owner/artisan of the service. This message includes the client requirements and the necessary
fees to be paid for the service. Thus, a contract is established between the owner/artisan ans the client. The contract can be deleted or edited by the artisan.

When an artisan gets to the app, he/she is required to register as employee to be able to post his/her service. Afterwards, he/she creates the service.
The service details will include the name, description, expire date of service, fees, etc. It is instantly displayed on the home page. Later on when the app is monitised,
a daily fee will be charged for the service until the expire date. The service can be deleted or edited by the owner/artisan.
